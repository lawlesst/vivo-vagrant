	// Using the SNARL API
	// -------------------
	// In this example we'll walk through the basic usage of the Stardog Native API for the RDF Language (SNARL)
	// API, which is the preferred way to interact with Stardog.  This will show how to use both the administrative
	// and client APIs to perform some basic operations.
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		// Creating a Server
		// -----------------
		// You'll need a server to connect to, obviously.  The `Stardog`
		// class provides a simple [builder interface](http://docs.stardog.com/java/snarl/com/complexible/stardog/Stardog.html) to specify which protocol
		// the server should use (options are HTTP & SNARL) and takes a `SocketAddress`
		// the server should bind to.  This will return you a `Server` object which
		// can be used to start & stop the Stardog server.
		//
		// This example shows up to create and start the embedded SNARL server.  Note that
		// you can only embed the *SNARL* server, not HTTP.
		Server aServer = Stardog
			                 .buildServer()
			                 .bind(SNARLProtocolConstants.EMBEDDED_ADDRESS)
			                 .start();

		// Using AdminConnection
		// ---------------------
		// Now that the server is running, we want to create a connection to the DBMS itself so we can do
		// some administrative stuff, namely, creating a new database to use for the purpose of this example.
		// We need to create a connection to perform administrative actions, so we can use the `AdminConnectionConfiguration`
		// utility class for opening the connection.
		//
		// Most operations supported by the DBMS require specific permissions, so either an admin account
		// is required, or a user who has been granted the ability to perform the actions.  You can learn
		// more about this in the [Security chapter](http://docs.stardog.com/security).
		AdminConnection aAdminConnection = AdminConnectionConfiguration.toEmbeddedServer()
		                                                               .credentials("admin", "admin")
		                                                               .connect();

		// With our admin connection, we're able to see if the database for this example already exists, and
		// if it does, we want to drop it and re-create so that we can run the example from a clean database.
		if (aAdminConnection.list().contains("testConnectionAPI")) {
			aAdminConnection.drop("testConnectionAPI");
		}

		// Convenience function for creating a non-persistent in-memory database with all the default settings.
		aAdminConnection.createMemory("testConnectionAPI");

		// *ALWAYS* close your connections!
		aAdminConnection.close();

		// Using the SNARL API
		// -------------------
		// Now that we've created our database for the example, let's open a connection to it.  For that we use the
		// [SNARLConnectionConfiguration](http://docs.stardog.com/java/snarl/com/complexible/stardog/api/SNARLConnectionConfiguration.html)
		// to configure and open a new connection to a database.
		//
		// We'll use the configuration to specify which database we want to connect to as well as our login information,
		// then we can obtain a new connection.
		Connection aConn = ConnectionConfiguration
			                   .to("testConnectionAPI")
			                   .credentials("admin", "admin")
			                   .connect();

		// All changes to a database *must* be performed within a transaction.  We want to add some data to the database
		// so we can begin firing off some queries, so first, we'll start a new transaction.
		aConn.begin();

		// The SNARL API provides fluent objects for adding & removing data from a database.  Here we'll use the
		// [Adder](http://docs.stardog.com/java/snarl/com/complexible/stardog/api/Adder.html) to read in an N3 file
		// from disk containing the 10k triples SP2B dataset.  Actually, for RDF data coming from a stream or from
		// disk, we'll use the helper class [IO](http://docs.stardog.com/java/snarl/com/complexible/stardog/api/IO.html)
		// for this task.  `IO` will automatically close the stream once the data has been read.
		aConn.add().io()
		     .format(RDFFormat.N3)
		     .stream(new FileInputStream("data/sp2b_10k.n3"));

		// You're not restricted to adding, or removing, data from a file.  You can create `Graph` objects
		// containing information you want to add or remove from the database and make the modification wit
		// that graph.  Here we'll create a new Graph and add a statement that we want added to our database.
		Graph aGraph = Graphs.newGraph(ValueFactoryImpl.getInstance()
		                                               .createStatement(ValueFactoryImpl.getInstance().createURI("urn:subj"),
		                                                                ValueFactoryImpl.getInstance().createURI("urn:pred"),
		                                                                ValueFactoryImpl.getInstance().createURI("urn:obj")));

		Resource aContext = ValueFactoryImpl.getInstance().createURI("urn:test:context");

		// With our newly created `Graph`, we can easily add that to the database as well.  You can also
		// easily specify the context the data should be added to.  This will insert all of the statements
		// in the `Graph` into the given context.
		aConn.add().graph(aGraph, aContext);

		// Now that we're done adding data to the database, we can go ahead and commit the transaction.
		aConn.commit();

		// Removing data from a database is just as easy.  Again, we need to start a transaction before making any changes.
		aConn.begin();

		// Now we'll use the [Remover](http://docs.stardog.com/java/snarl/com/complexible/stardog/api/Remover.html) to
		// remove some data from the database.  `Remover` has a very similar API to `Adder`, so this code should look
		// somewhat familiar.  It has many of the same methods as `Adder`, the only difference is that they'll cause
		// the triples to be removed instead of added.
		aConn.remove().io()
		     .format(RDFFormat.N3)
		     .file(new File("data/remove_data.nt"));

		// Lastly, we'll commit the changes.
		aConn.commit();

		// A SNARL connection provides [parameterized queries](http://docs.stardog.com/java/snarl/com/complexible/stardog/api/Query.html)
		// which you can use to easily build and execute SPARQL queries against the database.  First, let's create a simple
		// query that will get all of the statements in the database.
		SelectQuery aQuery = aConn.select("select * where { ?s ?p ?o }");

		// But getting *all* the statements is kind of silly, so let's actually specify a limit, we only want 10 results.
		aQuery.limit(10);

		// We can go ahead and execute this query which will give us a result set.  Once we have our result set, we can do
		// something interesting with the results.
		TupleQueryResult aResult = aQuery.execute();

		System.out.println("The first ten results...");

		QueryResultIO.write(aResult, TextTableQueryResultWriter.FORMAT, System.out);

		// *Always* close your result sets, they hold resources which need to be released.
		aResult.close();

		// `Query` objects are easily parameterized; so we can bind the "s" variable in the previous query with a specific value.
		// Queries should be managed via the parameterized methods, rather than created by concatenating strings together,
		// because that is not only more readable, it helps avoid SPARQL injection attacks.
		URI aURI = ValueFactoryImpl.getInstance().createURI("http://localhost/publications/articles/Journal1/1940/Article1");
		aQuery.parameter("s", aURI);

		// Now that we've bound 's' to a specific value, we're not going to pull down the entire database with our query
		// so we can go head and remove the limit and get all the results.
		aQuery.limit(SelectQuery.NO_LIMIT);

		// We've made our modifications, so we can re-run the query to get a new result set and see the difference in the results.
		aResult = aQuery.execute();

		System.out.println("\nNow a particular slice...");

		QueryResultIO.write(aResult, TextTableQueryResultWriter.FORMAT, System.out);

		// Again, *close* your result sets.
		aResult.close();

		// The previous query was just getting the statements in which the value of `aURI` is the subject.  We can get the
		// same results just as easily via the [Getter](http://docs.stardog.com/java/snarl/com/complexible/stardog/api/Getter.html)
		// interface.  `Getter` is designed to make it easy to list statements matching specific criteria; it's analogous to
		// `listStatements` or `match` in the Jena & Sesame APIs respectively.
		//
		// So here we'll create a `Getter` to obtain the list of statements with `aURI` as the subject.  If we print those
		// out we'll see that we've retrieved the same results as the query we just ran.
		Iteration<Statement, StardogException> aIter = aConn.get()
		                                                    .subject(aURI)
		                                                    .iterator();

		System.out.println("\nOr you can use a getter to do the same thing...");

		while (aIter.hasNext()) {
			System.out.println(aIter.next());
		}

		// `Iteration` objects are the same as Java `Iterator`'s with the only difference that 1) they can throw exceptions and 2)
		// they are closeable.  So you should make sure you close all your Iterations as well
		aIter.close();

		// `Getter` objects are parameterizable just like `Query`, so you can easily modify and re-use them to change
		// what slice of the database you'll retrieve.
		Getter aGetter = aConn.get();

		// We created a new `Getter`, if we iterated over its results now, we'd iterate over the whole database; not ideal.  So
		// we will bind the predicate to `rdf:type` and now if we call any of the iteration methods on the `Getter` we'd only
		// pull back statements whose predicate is `rdf:type`
		aGetter.predicate(RDF.TYPE);

		// We can also bind the subject and get a specific type statement, in this case, we'll get all the type triples
		// for *this* individual.  In our example, that'll be a single triple.
		aGetter.subject(aURI);

		aIter = aGetter.iterator();

		System.out.println("\nJust a single statement now...");

		while (aIter.hasNext()) {
			System.out.println(aIter.next());
		}

		// Close your Iterations!
		aIter.close();

		// `Getter` objects are stateful, so we can remove the filter on the predicate position by setting it back to null.
		aGetter.predicate(null);

		// Subject is still bound to the value of `aURI` so we can use the `graph` method of `Getter` to get a graph of all
		// the triples where `aURI` is the subject, effectively performing a basic describe query.
		aGraph = aGetter.graph();

		System.out.println("\nFinally, the same results as earlier, but as a graph...");

		GraphIO.writeGraph(aGraph, new OutputStreamWriter(System.out), RDFFormat.TURTLE);

		// Lastly, *always* close your Connections.
		aConn.close();

		// We're done with the example, so we need to make sure we shut down the server we started.
		aServer.stop();
